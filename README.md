# Traffic Light Control System

Traffic Light Control System
This project is a traffic light control system implemented using an STM32 microcontroller. The system simulates the operation of a traffic light at a crossroad, with features for controlling the timing of the red, amber, and green lights, as well as displaying the current mode and time duration on seven-segment LEDs.

## Features

- 12 LEDs representing the traffic lights (4 red, 4 amber, 4 green)
- 4 seven-segment LEDs for displaying time duration (2 for each road)
- 3 buttons for mode selection, time duration adjustment, and value setting
- 4 modes:
  - Normal mode: Traffic lights operate in a regular cycle
      - Modify red light time duration
      - Modify amber light time duration
      - Modify green light time duration
